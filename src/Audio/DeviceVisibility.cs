/// Pure filter helper that decides whether a device should appear in user-facing surfaces (tray
/// menu device entries, device-link sub-menus). Mirrors the precedence the user spec requires:
///   * the recording parent toggle gates every recording-flow child setting
///   * "show disabled" is the broad gate; "show default even if disabled" only matters when "show
///     disabled" is OFF (otherwise the disabled device already shows by default)
///   * Unplugged endpoints (real device, currently not connected) are gated by the per-flow
///     "show disconnected" switch
///   * NotPresent endpoints (registry-only ghosts whose driver isn't loaded) are gated by their
///     own cross-flow switch since they're rarely useful and cause "Unknown Device" floods
/// Render and capture share the same precedence layout but use distinct settings so the user can
/// run "no recording at all" while still showing every disabled playback device.
