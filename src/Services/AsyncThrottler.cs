/// Per-key "latest-pending-wins" payload scheduler.
///
/// For each <typeparamref name="TKey"/> at most one payload is in flight at a time; any payload scheduled while
/// a payload is running for the same key replaces the queued one (only the latest scheduled payload runs after
/// the in-flight one finishes), matching the slider-drag pattern where a flurry of intermediate values should
/// collapse into a single write of the final value.
///
/// After each payload completes the throttler waits <see cref="CooldownMs"/> before starting the next one for
/// that key, so writes can't happen faster than the configured rate-limit even when the hardware finishes them
/// quickly.
///
/// The throttler enforces ordering only - it has no opinion about what the payload does. A payload that needs
/// sequence atomicity against other operations on the same key should still hold the appropriate mutex itself.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The payload receives an <see cref="IThrottlerContext"/> so it can:
/// (a) honour cancellation when the throttler is disposed or the caller's token is signalled,
/// (b) probe <see cref="IThrottlerContext.HasReplacement"/> to bail early during retry/dwell waits when a fresher
/// payload has already been queued for the same key (no point completing the current write if a newer one will
/// overwrite it immediately anyway).
